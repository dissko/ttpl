description: Our Fun Time Circle program offers preschool-aged children a
  dynamic opportunity to explore and learn through creative process art.
  Children engage in interactive sessions where they discover tactile play with
  materials like playdough, rocks, evergreen branches, and even rabbit fur. They
  also experience community connection through visits from local helpers who
  share their unique stories.
