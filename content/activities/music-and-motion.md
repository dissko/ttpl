description: Music and Motion fills the library with an atmosphere of joy,
  learning, and creative expression. This program not only encourages early
  literacy by exposing children to the rhythms and patterns of language but also
  builds a sense of community through shared musical activities and movement.
  Participants experience interactive sessions that promote vocabulary
  development and self-expression.
