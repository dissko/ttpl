question: Is my child allowed to use the internet at the library?
answer: >-
  A child under 9 years of age may use the public access computers only if you
  are present.

  Please note: There are no filters on our computers, and access is not monitored. If a child is accessing the internet from their own wireless device, no permission is necessary.
