question: Do you take book or movie donations?
answer: As a small, rural library we accept books on a case-by-case basis.  We
  are generally looking for books that have been published in the past 5 years,
  games, art supplies, and some toys for younger children that are in excellent
  condition.  If you are looking at making a donation, please send information
  to tyendinagatwplibrary@gmail.com.
