question: I can't find the book I'm looking for. Is it possible to order it from
  another library?
answer: >-
  Yes! Inter Library Loan service is available to full-access patrons. In order
  to request a title, it must be over 2 years old.


  If the title you are looking for is available we will issue a request, and notify you when it comes in. Due dates are set by lending libraries, and no renewals are available.
