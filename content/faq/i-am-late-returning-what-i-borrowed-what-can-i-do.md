question: I am late returning what I borrowed. What can I do?
answer: Please return your borrowed materials as soon as possible. If the
  library is not open there is a drop box located outside the front door. If you
  have not finished with the materials, you may renew them (provided no one else
  is waiting) through email or phone.
