title: How do I get a library card?
subtitle: Library cards can only be obtained in person, as you must present
  valid proof of address and photo ID, as well as sign your card. If you are a
  resident of Tyendinaga Township, you may join free of charge. Children 12 &
  under must be signed up by their parent or guardian (valid ID required).
