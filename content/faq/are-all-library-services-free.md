question: Are all library services free?
answer: >-
  Almost. Most library services are free. Those that are not are outlined on
  the [services](/services) page.

  Programming: In circumstances where there is an above normal cost for a program (special guest, etc.), a fee may be charged for attendance. Donations are always gratefully accepted, and will be used directly for future events.
