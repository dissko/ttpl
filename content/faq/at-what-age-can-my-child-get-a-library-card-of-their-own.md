question: At what age can my child get a library card of their own?
answer: Library cards are available for any age, however, our suggestion is to
  wait until your child is old enough to recognize the value of their very own
  library card. Children are often quite excited by their first card, and if
  they are able to "sign" the card, it makes a lovely keepsake.
